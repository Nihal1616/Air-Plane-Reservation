Airline Ticket Reservation System (C++)

This project is a console-based Airline Ticket Reservation System built in C++ using fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks, and STL containers like vector, queue, and unordered_map. It simulates basic operations of booking, cancelling, and managing flight tickets for a single flight.

Data Structures Used:
•  Linked List: For dynamically managing the list of booked passengers.
•  Queue: To manage the waitlist in FIFO order.
•  Stack: To store and undo canceled tickets.
•  Vectors: To represent seat occupancy (true = booked, false = available).
•  Unordered Map: For managing multiple flights (currently supports one flight for simplicity).

Features:
